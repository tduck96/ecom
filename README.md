Katies Knicknacks
Ecommerce project, online marketspace to sell photography shots.

TechStack: React, Node, Express, MYSQL

Payment portal integrated from Stripe API. I have payment system set up with the test API key right now. To simulate an actual sale use a repeated 42 for card data. 

I built a simple login form but I disabled it for ease of use for those viewing this application. I plan on developing this further to integrate web tokens. I would like integrate a more complex database system to handle orders in future. I could build an administrative site. I could also build it out like Etsy, where individual users can POST new products into the marketplace. 

With a growing number of products, I could then build out a pagination feature, and of course both a filter and search component.   

I had some problems with CORS after deployment that I hadn't encountered in the past. I learned a lot about custom OPTIONS requests.
