Katies Knicknacks
Ecommerce project, online marketspace to sell photography shots.

React, Node, Express, MYSQL.
TechStack: React, Node, Express, MYSQL

Payment portal integrated from Stripe API. I have payment system set up with the test API key right now. To simulate an actual sale use a repeated 42 for card data. 

I built a simple login form but I disabled it for ease of use for those viewing this application.

I had some problems with CORS after deployment that I hadn't encountered in the past. I learned a lot about custom OPTIONS requests. 

Deployed on Heroku:
